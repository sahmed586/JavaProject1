This is my first exposure to programming in Java hence the more simple projects. Below is a description of each file and what is executed in the codes. 

futureInvestmentValue.java: Calculates the annual value of a user defined investment and interest rate from 1 to 30 years. 

stringSelectionSort.java: Sorts out an array of string elements in alphabeticla order via selection sort. 

scoolLockers.java: Solves an infamous school locker puzzle where a student opens all lockers, a second student closes every other locker, third student changes every third locker (from open to closed, closed to open), fourth student changes every fourth locker, and fifth student changes every fifth locker, all the way up to 100 lockers. This program outputs the lockers which remain open at the very end. Uses a nested for loop. 

Test.java: Uses an account class to display the bank account information of a predefined account. 

NestedForLoop.java: Prints out a pyramid of numerical elements in a specific pattern. 

locateLargest.java: Locates the largest element in an array via the "coordinates" or spot in the array.
